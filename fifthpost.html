                        <p>Socioeconomic Status includes income, educational attainment and occupation. These factors are one of the major driving forces of prevalence of diseases. Educational attainment affects your occupation which in turn affects your income. In the end, all these factors play a role in being exposed to some types of diseases like Type 2 Diabetes. In this article, the authors discuss the effect of socioeconomic status of Parents and Spouses on 21st century women in the United States from infancy to adulthood and how these factors  affect their prevalence of diabetes and obesity.</p>
                        <p>Due to income inequality in the USA and the world at large, some families are more exposed to diseases while others are not. High income families have the means to provide their family with good nutrition, medication, and good lifestyle practices that improves good health and most importantly they can acquire the luxury of good healthcare from top physicians. This is not the case for low income families. WHY? The answer is simple. Low income limits quality of life.</p>
                        <p>Be sure every paragraph has a main claim or takes the reader somewhere new. Then unpack that claim. What is significant? What do you want your viewer to remember? What is at stake?</p>
                        <p>Low income families in most cases may not be able  to afford bills, good food, good lifestyle activities and others. Due to this, they may suffer from stress and its related illness. As inferred from the article, low income families have a high chance of getting diabetes as compared to high income ones. By comparing the income/socioeconomic status of parents of these children, we see that the inequalities in the income leaves children from low income earning families at a higher risk of contracting diabetes. After marriage, the income/socioeconomic status of their spouses also played an important role in contracting the disease and this was consistent with the trend when they were younger.</p>
                       
                        
                    
                        <p>Each blog post should include an image and a PDF or a video. Included in the following lines is the code for including an image. In the link below, include your pdf. The image is the source, labeled src below. You simply have to follow the directory path to replace the image. The directory path as is is stating you will find this image if you go to assets, then image, and there you will find the image I have called. This must be the exact path. Changing punctutation or capitalization will mean the site cannot find your picture. Remember, machines are incredibly literal.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/keyhands.jpeg" alt="this is a description of your image for accessibility" /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">This is how you add captions under an image. Cite your image here. You may also say something about it, if you like.</span>
                        <p>Just like a quote, you should not leave an image resting there. Say something about what the image does for your site.</p>
                        <p>Finally, you may also include a video. Not every member has to do all three. Choose whether you want a video to cite and unpack or a PDF. If it is a video, you only need to include the video and information about it (your summary). If it is a PDF, you should include a picture.</p>
