                        <p>Research has shown that household income is largely impacted by racial inequality that stems from inequitable institutional practices over the years. How big of an impact have these practices left? Well, these historical practices of systemic racism have caused major disparities in income between racial groups and despite recent progressive movements seemingly helping the issue, the data tells a different story.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">How racism throughout history has affected today’s income gap</h2>
                        <p>In modern day America, the net worth of the average black family is equal to one-tenth the average net worth of a white family. The main reason for this? Everything goes back to the early 1800’s when slavery was the norm. Research shows that no progress has been made in reducing the wealth gap between racial groups since that time. Slavery was legally ended in 1865, but because of the delayed and oppressed start of the black community, the impacts are inescapable. It’s virtually been ensured that black Americans will face lower income rates than white Americans for this reason.</p>

                        <p>The above video is an episode called "Explained" from the Netflix series "The Racial Wealth Gap". Activists and researchers go into detail about the carry over effects from slavery and how minorities in society are suffering. It is discussed how centuries of discrimination have led the U.S. to have a detrimental amount of racial wealth gap.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Job Inequality</h2>
                        <p>There are specific examples of these inequalities in everyday life that affect income inequality as well. One of these examples is in relation to the resume process. In the typical hiring process, one submits their resume for review to a company they wish to work for. On this resume is the individual's name and address. Research has shown that having a “black-sounding” name on a resume can significantly impact an individual’s chances of being called in for an interview. Such discrimination is perpetuating income inequality by limiting opportunities for individuals in marginalized communities.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Importance of Income Equality</h2>
                        <p>Examples such as the resume one reflect how income inequality goes hand in hand with racism and the cycle continues to grow. From the historical aspects to the everyday actions of society, it has become impossible for the income gap to decrease. It seems as if there is always another social issue where equality is being fought for, but there has been no progress in income inequality between racial groups in 70 years. It is time for society to join the fight toward income equality. Break this cycle of racism and create a fairer future for all.</p>
